-- Project [Credit Limit Increase Campaign]
-- It is a typical credit card limit campaign. The bank sends 5400 offers to its customers and 
-- provide the opportunity to increase their current credit limit. When a customer receives the 
-- offer, he/she will call the bank. The customer service person will check the customerâ€™s 
-- status at the time of call, and decide whether to approve or decline the offer.
-- After dropping the campaign, the bank starts to monitor the campaign.
-- You have a few tables to complete the monitoring:
-- * Base table: includes the base population which the bank selects to provide this 
-- offer
-- * Call_record table: has the call records from these customers by day. The bank 
-- uses the call record to evaluate the response rate
-- * Decision table: has the final decision regarding each offer. AP=Approval; 
-- DL=Decline
-- * Change_record table: has the credit limit change record in the system
-- * Letter table: the bank needs to send approval letter or decline letter to customers 
-- accordingly. For example, if the customer speaks English, the bank must send 
-- letter in English. The correct letter code should be:
--      English approval letter = AE001
--      English Decline letter = RE001
--      French Approval letter = AE002
--      French Decline letter = RE002
